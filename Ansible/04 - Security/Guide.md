# Security

**Security should be the first thing you think of. Not in step(Lab) #4.** 

In this section you will:

- Create a secret in an existing Azure Key Vault.
- Modify your playbook so that you reference the secret in your playbook.

## Add secret 

Azure Key Vault is a tool for securely storing and accessing secrets.

For simplicity, we have provisioned an Azure Key Vault for each lab participant. 

## Additional useful resources

This [sample playbook](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ansible-playbooks/blob/master/keyvault_create.yml) for a good walk-through of creating an Azure Key Vault.
